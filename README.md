# UCSF-AI4ALL
Machine learning project analyzing the vaginal microbiome to predict pregnancy outcomes. Includes data cleaning, visualization, PCA, and supervised/unsupervised models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, KNN, Perceptron, K-Means).

## Limitations

This project was originally completed during a summer research program (2023). Some of the raw data files (e.g., certain .csv inputs referenced in the notebook) may no longer be available, which can lead to missing file errors (FileNotFoundError).

To address this, Iâ€™ve kept the code and workflows intact so that others can still see the data cleaning, visualization, and machine learning pipeline design, even if specific files are not present.
